# Env Set Up
Is is essential that this project is set up using python 3.6 and a conda environment. This is not a preference of the
author, however a requirement enforced by the compatibility requirements of the Mordred Chemical Descriptor python package 
at the time of writing. For further install details and to confirm this is still essential, please see the official Mordred 
Github Page (https://github.com/mordred-descriptor/mordred)
